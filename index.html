      <p class="mainMsg">Do you remember when we were the topper kind of students who only used
        who only used to talk in english. We were always all over the place when came to 
        links of classes. Now lets skip to <em>Dec 17 2021</em>. This was the day when
        I was reminded by apeksha to wish you and since at the time Sam was a good friend of mine
        I suggested her to do the same but in a special way. With the most rubbish 
        prank of all time.
        ig you remember what I made for you in the form of an illustration
        that you got teased for by apeksha and vani XD!
