      <h1>Its your birthday meri vidu!</h1>
      <p class="mainMsg">Do you remember when we were the topper kind of students who only used
        who only used to talk in english. We were always all over the place when came to 
        links of classes. Now lets skip to <em>Dec 17 2021</em>. This was the day when
        I was reminded by apeksha to wish you and since at the time Sam was a good friend of mine
        I suggested her to do the same but in a special way. With the most rubbish 
        prank of all time.
        ig you remember what I made for you in the form of an illustration
        that you got teased for by apeksha and vani XD!

        10th of august was a day full of rollercoaster of emotions and I even cried 
        but holding hands with you was the best part of the day and yeah I am still
        really sorry for the blunder that day but I do hope you will forgive me if possible.
        I also want to mention that right after this day we did became much closer but with that
        also came a bunch of fights in the month of september and I still remember how much
        we both cried during the fight of "20day break". Sunn but vidu I used to love you at 
        that time and even today and the love is increasing everyday!!. I love you so much vidushi.
